I"e<p>I just want to restore SYSTEM/SYSAUX/UNDOTBS to a specific time in order to use flashback query on some dictionary table to determine the exact time of a mistake.</p>

<p>When I tried to use a normal way to restore database, like:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sql linenums=1 ">
RMAN&gt; run{
2&gt; set dbid 766629926;
3&gt; restore controlfile from AUTOBACKUP;
4&gt; }

RMAN&gt; alter database mount;

RMAN&gt; run{
2&gt; set UNTIL sequence 66;
3&gt; restore tablespace SYSTEM,SYSAUX,UNDOTBS1;
4&gt; }
</pre>

<p>When I do recover, RMAN-06067 reported. This is because this is a backup controlfile, and cannot just do RECOVER TABLESPACE on same specific tablespaces.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sql linenums=1 ">
RMAN&gt; run{
2&gt; set UNTIL sequence 66;
3&gt; recover tablespace SYSTEM,SYSAUX,UNDOTBS1;
4&gt; }

executing command: SET until clause

Starting recover at 22-MAR-19
using channel ORA_DISK_1

RMAN-00571: ===========================================================
RMAN-00569: =============== ERROR MESSAGE STACK FOLLOWS ===============
RMAN-00571: ===========================================================
RMAN-03002: failure of recover command at 03/22/2019 12:40:29
RMAN-06067: RECOVER DATABASE required with a backup or created control file
</pre>

<p>We should use “recover database skip tablespace” to achieve this goal.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sql linenums=1 ">
RMAN&gt; run{
2&gt; set until sequence 66;
3&gt; recover database skip tablespace USERS,"PDB$SEED":SYSTEM,"PDB$SEED":SYSAUX,"PDB$SEED":UNDOTBS1,HR:SYSTEM,HR:SYSAUX,HR:UNDOTBS1;
4&gt; }

<p>But the better way to do DPITR/TSPITR is to use DUPLICATE</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-sql linenums=1 ">
run{

set until time "to_date('20190322 130700','yyyymmdd hh24miss')";
