I"z<p>I have an artile about Application Failover<br />
https://westzq1.github.io/oracle/2019/02/04/Application-Failover-1.html</p>

<p>But I didnâ€™t have any test about the how TAF&amp;FCF work with DBLINK</p>

<p>Today, I find an doc about this:
Database Link: DBLink Creation using TAF or SCAN TNS Connect String (Doc ID 399453.1)</p>

<p>The key points are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Database links do not support Transparent Application Failover.</li>
  <li>Configuring a dblink using a SCAN listener address in the TNS connect descriptor is not recommended.</li>
  <li>A DBLink connection is more reliable using a local listener(VIP)</li>
</ol>

<p>I tested wit FCF also in 11.2.0.4 and 18.3.0.0, it is also not working with DBLINK, like TAF.</p>

<p>But with FAILOVER=ON attribute in TNS, at least the connection can reconnect to another node with retry.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sql linenums=1 ">
SQL&gt; select instance_number from v$instance@to_o11204_taf
  2  ;

INSTANCE_NUMBER
---------------
	      1

-- kill instance 1
SQL&gt; /

INSTANCE_NUMBER
---------------
	      2
</pre>

<p>AC also is tested and not working with DBLINK.</p>
